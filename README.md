## Overview

The **Library Management System** is a web-based application designed to help manage books, authors, categories, fines, and checkouts. The system uses a dashboard that allows the user to view and manipulate book entries, track available copies, and perform basic CRUD operations. It also includes a report feature to track analytics.

## Features

- Manage Books (Add, Edit, Delete, View)
- Manage Authors and Categories
- View Checkouts and Fines
- Real-time updates after book deletion
- Responsive design for a better user experience
- Data persistence using **H2 Database** (for development)
- Login functionality using **Firebase Authentication**

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: UI development framework
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For responsive and accessible components
- **React Router**: For routing and navigation
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend
- **DataGrid** (MUI): For displaying and managing tabular data

### Backend:
- **Spring Boot**: Java-based backend framework
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: For data access and persistence
- **Spring Security**: For securing the API
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions

### API and Services:
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing books, authors, categories, and checkouts
- **Firebase Authentication**: Used for user login and authentication

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed
- **Maven** (for building Spring Boot)

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Go to the backend directory:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Build the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash

   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

### H2 Database:

To access the H2 in-memory database used for development:

- URL: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- Username: `sa`
- Password: `<leave empty>`

## Usage
